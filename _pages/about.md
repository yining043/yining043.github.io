Hi, I am a Postdoctoral Associate at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/)'s [Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)](https://lids.mit.edu/), mentored by [Prof. Cathy Wu](http://www.wucathy.com/blog/). Previously, I was a Research Fellow at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), supervised by [Prof. Jie Zhang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/zhangj/). I obtained my Ph.D. in Industrial Systems Engineering at National University of Singapore (NUS) in 2024, where I was mentored by [Prof. Zhiguang Cao](https://zhiguangcaosg.github.io/) and honored to be advised by [Prof. Yeow Meng Chee](https://ymchee66.github.io/home/). I received my B.E. from South China University of Technology (SCUT) in 2019, advised by [Prof. Yuejiao Gong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Mi0Zu3IAAAAJ&hl=en). 

I am also working closely with [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/), [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/), [Symbotic](https://www.symbotic.com/) and [Grab (SG)](https://www.grab.careers/en/jobs/?page=2&search=scientist&country=Singapore&pagesize=20#results). 

My research is at the intersection of **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Optimization**. I have published 30+ papers in top-tier conferences such as *ICML*, *NeurIPS*, *ICLR*, etc, and top-tier journals such as *TPAMI*, *JAIR*, *TNNLS*, *TITS*, etc. I am an **Area Chair (AC)** for *NeurIPS* and actively review for AI conferences and journals, recognized with multiple best reviewer awards.

💡 Research Interests
-----
My research has focused on the emerging field of "**Learning to Optimize (L2Opt)**", where we develop state-of-the-art AI-driven frameworks/approaches for addressing challenging decision-making problems, e.g., combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). My research drives innovative solutions in broad application domains with real-world complexities such as LLM reasoning, LLM for Optimization task formulation, large-scale vehicle routing in logistics, multi-robot coordination in automated warehouse, complex resource scheduling, path planning, etc.
<!-- My research in L2Opt spans various ML perspectives, such as representation learning, foundation model development, efficient training/inference framework design, out-of-distribution generalization, multi-agent coordination, decision-making in dynamic environments, etc. -->
