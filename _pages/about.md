Hi, I am a Postdoctoral Associate at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/)'s [Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)](https://lids.mit.edu/), mentored by [Prof. Cathy Wu](http://www.wucathy.com/blog/). Previously, I was a Research Fellow at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), working with [Prof. Jie Zhang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/zhangj/) and [Prof. Zhiguang Cao](https://zhiguangcaosg.github.io/). I obtained my Ph.D. in Industrial Systems Engineering at National University of Singapore (NUS) in 2024, where I was honored to be advised by [Prof. Yeow Meng Chee](https://ymchee66.github.io/home/). I received my B.E. from South China University of Technology (SCUT) in 2019, advised by [Prof. Yuejiao Gong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Mi0Zu3IAAAAJ&hl=en).

I am working at the intersection of **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Optimization**. I have published 20+ papers in top-tier conferences such as *ICML*, *NeurIPS*, *ICLR*, etc, and top-tier journals such as *TPAMI*, *TNNLS*, *SMCA*, *TITS*, etc. I am an **Area Chair (AC)** for *NeurIPS* and actively review for top AI conferences and journals, recognized with multiple best reviewer awards. 


Welcome to see my [publications](https://yining043.github.io/publications/), [academic services](https://yining043.github.io/service/), [experience](https://yining043.github.io/experience/), and [honors & awards](https://yining043.github.io/honors/). Drop me an email if you‚Äôd like to **collaborate or discuss** with me! You may approach me at:
* **Office**: 45-611, 51 Vassar St, Cambridge, MA 02139 
* **E-mail**: yiningma [at] mit [dot] edu

üí° Research Interests
-----
My research has focused on the emerging field of "**Learning to Optimize (L2Opt)**", where the latest AI/ML techniques are exploited to develop state-of-the-art frameworks/approaches for addressing challenging optimization problems including combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) and black-box optimization (BBO) tasks. My research drives solutions in broad application domains with real-world complexities such as large-scale vehicle routing in logistics, multi-robot coordination in automated warehouse, complex resource scheduling, public transit network design, path planning, protein docking, hyperparameter tuning, etc.
<!-- My research in L2Opt spans various ML perspectives, such as representation learning, foundation model development, efficient training/inference framework design, out-of-distribution generalization, multi-agent coordination, decision-making in dynamic environments, etc. -->
