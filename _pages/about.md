Hi, I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/)'s [Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)](https://lids.mit.edu/), mentored by [Prof. Cathy Wu](http://www.wucathy.com/blog/). Previously, I was a Research Fellow at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), collaborating with [Prof. Jie Zhang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/zhangj/) and [Prof. Zhiguang Cao](https://zhiguangcaosg.github.io/) (from SMU). I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Industrial Systems Engineering at National University of Singapore (NUS), in March 2024, where I am honored to be advised by [Prof. Yeow Meng Chee](https://ymchee66.github.io/home/). I received my B.E. degree from School of Computer Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology (SCUT), in June 2019, advised by [Prof. Yuejiao Gong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Mi0Zu3IAAAAJ&hl=en).

I am working at the intersection of **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Optimization**, striving to develop automated ML solutions to address complex optimization and decision-making challenges. My research has been featured in top-tier conferences such as *ICML*, *NeurIPS*, *ICLR*, etc, and top-tier journals such as *TPAMI*, *TNNLS*, *SMCA*, *TITS*, etc. I serve as an Area Chair (AC) for *NeurIPS* and *IEEE CAI* and have been an active Reviewer/PC member for various top-tier conferences, workshops, and journals, recognized with best reviewer awards.

üí° Research Interests
-----
My research has primarily focused on the emerging field of "**Learning to Optimize (L2Opt)**", where the latest ML techniques (e.g., reinforcement learning, deep learning, large language models, etc) are exploited to develop state-of-the-art ML-powered frameworks/approaches for addressing challenging real-world optimization problems (e.g., combinatorial optimization, discrete optimization, black-box optimization, mixed integer linear programming, etc). My research in L2Opt spans various ML perspectives, such as representation learning, foundation model development, efficient training/inference framework design, out-of-distribution generalization, multi-agent coordination, decision-making in dynamic environments, etc.

**Research Keywords**
- **Machine Learning**: Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, Large Language Model (LLM), Federated/Distributed Learning, Multi-Agent Systems, Interpretability
- **Optimization**: Combinatorial Optimization, Black-Box Optimization, MILP
- **Application**: Routing, Planning, Scheduling, Transportation, Autonomous Vehicles
