<span style="color:red">News:</span> I will join the [Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)](https://lids.mit.edu/) at MIT as a Postdoctoral Associate in August 2024, mentored by [Prof. Cathy Wu](http://www.wucathy.com/blog/)!

Hi, I am currently a Research Fellow at College of Computing and Data Science, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), working in collaboration with [Prof. Jie Zhang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/zhangj/). I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Industrial Systems Engineering at National University of Singapore (NUS), in March 2024, where I am honored to be advised by [Prof. Yeow Meng Chee](https://ymchee66.github.io/home/). I received my B.E. degree from School of Computer Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology (SCUT), in June 2019, supervised by [Prof. Yuejiao Gong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Mi0Zu3IAAAAJ&hl=en). I have also collaborated closely with [Prof. Zhiguang Cao](https://zhiguangcaosg.github.io/) from Singapore Management University (SMU). 

I am working at the intersection of **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Optimization**, striving to develop automated ML solutions to address complex optimization and decision-making challenges. My research has been featured in top-tier conferences such as *ICML*, *NeurIPS*, *ICLR*, *KDD*, *IJCAI*, etc, and top-tier journals such as *TNNLS*, *TCYB*, *SMCA*, *TITS*, etc. I have served as an Area Chair for the *IEEE CAI* conference and actively served as a Reviewer/PC Member for top-tier conferences, workshops, and journals.

Welcome to see my [publications](https://yining043.github.io/publications/), [academic services](https://yining043.github.io/service/), [experience](https://yining043.github.io/experience/), and [honors & awards](https://yining043.github.io/honors/), and welcome to reach out for collaboration! You may approach me at:
* E-mail: yiningma [at] u [dot] nus [dot] edu
* Phone: +65 8291 7017


💡 Research Interests
-----
My research has primarily focused on the emerging field of "**Learning to Optimize (L2Opt)**", where the latest ML techniques (e.g., reinforcement learning, deep learning, large language models, etc) are exploited to develop state-of-the-art ML-powered frameworks/approaches for addressing challenging optimization problems (e.g., combinatorial optimization, black-box optimization, multi-objective optimization, etc). My research in L2Opt spans various ML perspectives, such as representation learning, foundation model development, efficient training/inference framework design, out-of-distribution generalization, multi-agent coordination, decision-making in dynamic environments, etc.

**Research Keywords**
- **Machine Learning**: Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, Large Language Model (LLM), Federated/Distributed Learning, Multi-Agent Systems
- **Optimization**: Combinatorial Optimization, Black-Box Optimization
- **Application**: Routing, Planning, Logistics, Transportation, Autonomous Vehicles
